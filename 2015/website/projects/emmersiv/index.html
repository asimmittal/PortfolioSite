                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>
                        The prevalence of Autism is rising. 1 in 50 kids is now diagnosed with a form of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).
                        The primary mode of treatment for children with Autism is behavioral therapy which is delivered in a face-to-face
                        setting by a certifed behavioral analyst. Often, these therapy sessions cost a lot and most clinics don't have the
                        bandwidth to provide the required hours of treatment to kids affected by Autism.<br><br>
                        
                        I led the design of a solution, together with my team at the West Health Institute, to research new and engaging methods of delivering
                        behavioral therapy to children on the spectrum. Over the course of my research, we built numerous prototypes and
                        even a ran a small clinical study to see if kids with Autism can learn from digital tools.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Emmersiv system uses the Microsoft Kinect and offers a host of mini-games that kids can play as a reward for 
                        doing their therapy. The system delivers social skills therapy with emphasis on the following areas<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Understanding Affect</li>
                            <li>Sportsmanship</li>
                            <li>Attending to Conversations</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Design Process</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our design process had four major phases. With each phase, we made changes to our approach (clinically or technologically)
                        and gradually shifted towards the current direction.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Phase I: Observation</h4>
                    <p>
                        When the project began, I knew little about Autism or the challenges kids with this disorder faced. In a bid to educate
                        myself about my target audience, we conducted "fly on the wall" studies to observe kids from across the spectrum interact
                        with off the shelf Kinect games. We soon learned that the range of abilities across the spectrum varied immensely.<br><br>
                        
                        Kids with low to moderate severity had shorter attention spans and less than ideal motor skills. These kids struggled
                        to use the Kinect. On the other hand, kids with higher functioning autism had abilities analogous to their neurotypical
                        peers. They were able to pick up the gestural interaction metaphor within a few exposures to the Kinect system.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="phase1_observe1.jpg" width="100%"/>
                    
                    <h4>Phase II: Protoyping</h4>
                    <p>
                        Armed with the findings from our observational research, we began ideation. We came up with various interaction 
                        metaphors around choice making behavior, feedback, prompting and reorienting kids back in view of the Kinect, if they
                        stepped away from the playing area. Each metaphor was tested with kids and rated against recognition and ease of use.
                        With the basic research around interaction completed, we proceeded to design the remainder of the prototype. This version
                        utilized simple 2D games and cartoons as motivators for kids to endure their therapy (discrete trial based approach to teach
                        basic language skills).

                    <h4>Phase III: Research</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here's what I learnt from the previous stage of prototyping:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Timely scheduling of rewards in between therapy will prolong engagement</li>
                            <li>Content was too basic. Higher functioning kids needed something else</li>
                            <li>The fidelity of content needs to be higher (comparable to what kids play regularly)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        So while our mechanic for oscillating between reward and therapy worked well, our fidelity and content wasn't
                        rich enough to keep kids engaged for a long period of time. We decided to move away from simple 2D games to richer
                        3D games that would be built in Unity3D. <br><br>
                        
                        We expanded our team and added professional artists and game developers to our team. At the same time, we brought
                        in experienced therapists and special ed teachers to help us understand what would be more impactful to teach (other
                        than language skills)<br><br>

                        <h4>Phase IV: Design + Build</h4>
                        <p>
                            The key takeaways from the research phase were:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Social Skills was a core deficit of Autism. Build around this idea</li>
                                <li>Teach social skills through video models (kids spectate interactions and comment upon what they saw)</li>
                                <li>Delayed gratification must be incorporated in some form</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Keeping these in mind, the team decided to use the metaphor of a video game arcade. The video game arcade is
                            a social setting that offers a framework for playing games (reward) and spectating interactions other people
                            had in the arcade. Here are the artifacts at various stages of design.<br><br>

                        <h4>Designing interactions for kids</h4>
                        <p>
                            Since we were working with a variety of ages and abilities (even within the smaller subgroup of school aged children with 
                            higher functioning autism), there were several challenges in building interaction metaphors that were easy for the kids
                            to pick up and uniquely detectable by the Kinect sensor.<br><br>
                            
                            One of the biggest drawbacks of using a sensor such as the Kinect is that smaller bodies produce noisy skeleton data.
                            During some of our earlier tests, we realized that the elbow joint was often confused for the shoulder when the child
                            stuck his/her arm forward such that the hand occluded the shoulder. Issues like this forced us to design a gestural
                            vocabulary that was based on more coarse movements such as leaning left/right (spinal column), raising both arms up and
                            movement of the arm as a whole to point at different objects. We prototyped and tested at least six different interaction metaphors before settling on the gestures shown in this 
                            video.

                        <br>
            
                        <h4>Designing for in-home use</h4>
                        <p>
                            While it may not seem intuitive, the home is a very dynamic environment. This is true even more so, for families with kids on the
                            Autism spectrum. During our initial tests, we realized that siblings, pets, furniture and even the variation in ambient
                            lighting could potentially act as additional sources of noise for the Kinect. Furniture could be falsely recognized as
                            a user and as much as we would try, siblings would often find it hard to resist the appeal of the game itself. For these
                            reasons, we implemented a player lock mechanism.<br><br>
                            
                            While locking down all recognition of gestures to a single player wasn't very challenging, we had to find a subtle way to
                            insert this mechanism into the app. At the beginning of the game, the player would open the door of the arcade to enter it.
                            We tied this action to a hand raise gesture and locked onto the skeleton that performed this.<br><br>
                            
                            This turned out to be extremely simple. Most user's complied with this protocol unknowingly as it happened early enough in
                            the lifetime of the application.

                            During the course of the build, the team came up with numerous ideas for engaging mini games that would serve as motivators
                            for kids to do their therapy. While this was a key component of our design, we didn't want to re-invent the wheel and
                            borrowed mechanics from existing games which were big hits with kids. Here are snapshots of the games we created. Besides
                            fun games, we also created 6 core characters, each with their own personalities. This cast of characters featured in over

                        <h4>Clinical Study</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once the application was completed, we deployed the prototype in nine homes as part of a single subject study for
                            Rady Children's Hospital. The application was deployed on the Alienware Alpha gaming console. The study ran for
                            six months. Here are the key features of the study design:
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pre Assessment (BEFORE)</li>
                                <li>Intervention </li>
                                <li>Post Assessment (AFTER)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            In order to perform a pre and post assessment, I built an Android app that supervisors could use to gauge the
                            child's proficiency. This app was basically a video assessment tool. The child would watch videos of social
                            scenarios (based on the same curriculum) and answer a few questions pertaining to what they saw in the video.

                        <img src="videoassessment.jpg" width="100%"/>
            
                        <h4>Gathering data</h4>
                        <p>
                            The app would track the user's performance. There were numerous streams of data. The most obvious ones were around gameplay,
                            their overall usage and their responses to the various questions posed after watching a social vignette. Besides data about
                            how they used the app, we also took snapshots using the Kinect camera every time the game began. This proved useful later on
                            when we wanted to establish if the child was in fact the participant and not his/her sibling.

                        <h4>Research Findings</h4>
                        <p>
                            The study is currently being concluded and published. To summarize, here's what we learnt from the study:
                            <ul>
                                <li>It is possible to deliver social skills therapy in the home using an automated system</li>
                                <li>8/9 participants completed the entire course of therapy as prescribed</li>
                                <li>Our system was able to motivate and teach kids, in a manner similar to an actual therapist, but at a lower cost</li>
                                <li>Most kids remained engaged with their therapy even after the novelty of the games wore off</li>
                                <li>Kids demonstrated that they learnt content they didn't know before</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
