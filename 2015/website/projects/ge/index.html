                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>
                        Radiologists spend hours on end reviewing medical images (x-rays, MRIs etc.) on their terminals. 
                        A large part of their time is spent in dealing with interruptions on the phone or in person, making 
                        them less productive due to excessive context switching. Also the tools they use to handle 
                        communications with other stakeholders are outdated and not integrated with the tools they use to get their work done.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Synaptic is a collaboration tool that integrates with the radiologists' current RIS/PACS system (used to read and review images)
                        and provides them instant access to their colleagues. They can share case files with the colleagues and even invite them for
                        a collaborative viewing of an image with useful features to highlight and mark images during the discussion.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Process - Overview</h4>
                    <img src="iterations.jpg" width="100%" style="border:1px solid #fbfbfb">
                    <p>
                        The final concept for Synaptic was built over four iterations of the user centered design process. With each iteration, we focused
                        in on the final feature set. Each iteration ended with testing our prototypes with users. Finally, we delivered the research, wireframes, 
                        a consolidated design spec and an interactive prototype to GE Healthcare over a period of 8 months.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>
                        We began our research by interviewing radiology residents at University of Pittsburgh to get a general idea of how radiologists typically
                        their day. After doing our homework, we set out on a journey across four major hospital systems in the United States, shadowing and observing
                        radiologits, imaging technicians, nurses and other stakeholders in the radiology ecosystem.

                        <div class="img" style="background: url('research03.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:200%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        
                        <!-- controls: left / right --->
                        <span class="ctrlLeft"><div></div></span>
                        <span class="ctrlRight"><div></div></span>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We synthesized our findings, developed workflow models and highlighted breakdowns in the radiology workflow. Next, we brainstormed 
                        ideas which might help radiologists overcome some of these breakdowns. Through a careful aggregation process, we narrowed down thirty small ideas 
                        into ten larger ideas. We rated these based on their impact/achievability ratio and pitched them to our clients at GE Healthcare to gauge their 
                        enthusiasm.

                    <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following the research phase, the team began putting ideas on paper. We prototyped various features through sketches
                        on paper and with continuous feedback from our users, refined them to cleaner and more structured wireframe. These wireframes
                        were used to build an interactive prototype (built in WPF and C#). As we tested and iterated over our features, we combined paper mockups of
                        new designs with the existing interactive prototype to give our users a glimpse of how the product was changing.

                    <p>
                        We delivered our research findings to GE Healthcare in the form of an exhaustive report, an interactive prototype and a design
                        specification. You can read the entire report on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AsimMittal/synaptic-a-communication-collaboration-tool-for-radiology">my slideshare</a>.
