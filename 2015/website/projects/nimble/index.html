                        Nimble Schedule approached me to work on the UX of their web and mobile applications. Their existing application
                        was extremely nuanced with various settings and configurations. They wanted me to simplify their UX and add make
                        their users more efficient.
                        
                        I worked on revamping the UX for three applications:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mobile app for managers and employees</li>
                            <li>Web application (mainstay of their business)</li>
                            <li>Tablet based timeclock application</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Please note that the images shown below constitute only a small portion of the work that was done. Higher fidelity samples
                        might be provided on request.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Mobile</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here are a few screens I worked on from the mobile app. The challenging part
                        of this app was to boil down all the features of their web app to a simpler, more frequently used set. This app allowed
                        managers and employees to manage their shifts, trade shifts, message each other, pick up open shifts and allow them to check
                        in or out of a specific location.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I used a timeline based feed to unify all activity around how people in a company were communicating and managing shifts. This 
                        idea took a large part of the UI, which was fragmented and brought it all together in a simple format that users preferred and
                        understood.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="imageSlider" style="border:1px solid #dadada">
                        <!--divs for images -->
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('1_marquee_a.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:0%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('1_marquee_b.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:100%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('2_scheduling.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:200%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('3_employees.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:300%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <!-- controls: left / right --->
                        <span class="ctrlLeft"><div></div></span>
                        <span class="ctrlRight"><div></div></span>
                    </div>
                
                    <h4>Web</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here are some of the wireframes I designed for their web application. This was a large application, so I've only provided
                        a few screenshots that highlight specific features such as scheduling, employee management and settings. Again, higher fidelity samples
                        are available on request.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="imageSlider" style="border:1px solid #dadada">
                        <!--divs for images -->
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('web_1.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:0%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('web_2.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:100%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('web_3.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:200%;background-size:contain"></div>
                        <!-- controls: left / right --->
                        <span class="ctrlLeft"><div></div></span>
                        <span class="ctrlRight"><div></div></span>
                    </div>
                
                    <h4>Time Clock</h4>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the web app and mobile app, I also designed a small application for a tablet based 
                        time clock. This allowed employees to check in or out for a shift using facial recognition or traditional
                        numeric entry
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="imageSlider" style="border:1px solid #dadada">
                        <!--divs for images -->
                        <div class="img" style="background: url('ipad_clock.jpg') no-repeat;margin-left:0%;background-size:contain"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
