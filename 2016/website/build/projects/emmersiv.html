<h5>Background</h5>
<p>
    The prevalence of Autism is rising. 1 in 50 kids is now diagnosed with a form of Autism. The primary mode of treatment for children with Autism is behavioral therapy which is delivered in person by a certifed behavioral analyst. Parents can pay as much as a $100 per hour of therapy. These costs add up quickly over the course of therapy, which typically ranges over a few years.

<p>
    Over the course of three years, I led the design and development for a Kinect based system that delivered therapy through the format of video games. Our experience mimiced best practices used by behavioral therapists. Our greatest achievement was establishing a model that allowed easy scaling of motivational and therapeutic content.
